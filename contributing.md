Contributing
This repository uses cr.joyent.us (Gerrit) for new changes. Anyone can submit changes. To get started, see the cr.joyent.us user guide. This repo does not use GitHub pull requests.

See the Joyent Engineering Guidelines for general best practices expected in this repository.

Contributions should be "make prepush" clean. The "prepush" target runs the "check" target, which requires these separate tools:

If you're changing something non-trivial or user-facing, you may want to submit an issue first.
